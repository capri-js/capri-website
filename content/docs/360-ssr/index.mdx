title: Server-side Rendering
---

Although Capri is primarily a static site generator, you can also use it
to dynamically generate HTML on a server or in a serverless environment.

## Generating an SSR bundle

Under the hood, Capri performs an [SSR build](https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html#building-for-production)
when generating pages. Normally, this SSR bundle is deleted at the end of the build process.

In order to render pages dynamically on demand, we have to get hold of this bundle before it gets deleted.
This can be done by setting Capri's `target` option in the `vite.config.ts` file:

```js
export default {
  plugins: [
    react(),
    capri({
      prerender: false,
      target: "src/ssr.js",
    }),
  ],
};
```

This will generate a copy of the SSR bundle at `src/ssr.js`.

<Note>
  We also set `prerender` to `false` to disable the generation of static pages
  during the build.
</Note>

## Importing the SSR bundle

During runtime, we can then import the generated bundle:

```ts
import { loadSSRModule } from "capri";

// We need to pass an absolute path
const resolve = (p: string) => new URL(p, import.meta.url).pathname;

async function createApp() {
  const ssr = await loadSSRModule(resolve("./ssr.js"));

  // We can now use ssr() to render pages ...
}
```

## Rendering pages

Finally, we call the `ssr()` function with the requested URL. We can pass an optional `RenderContext`, to support setting HTTP headers and the status code from inside our app.

```ts
app.use("*", async (req, res) => {
  // Implement the RenderContext interface and map the calls to
  // their Express counterparts:
  const context: RenderContext = {
    status: (code) => res.status(code),
    getHeader: (name) => req.get(name),
    setHeader: (name, value) => res.setHeader(name, value),
  };

  const html = await ssr(req.originalUrl, context);

  if (res.statusCode === 200) {
    res.send(html);
  }
  res.end();
});
```

## Serverless and Edge Runtimes

Capri also supports [Cloudflare Pages](https://github.com/capri-js/capri/tree/main/packages/cloudflare)
and [Vercel](https://github.com/capri-js/capri/tree/main/packages/vercel) deployments.

Here's an [example](https://github.com/fgnass/capri-on-the-edge) that runs as [Vercel Edge Function](https://vercel.com/features/edge-functions).
