title: Client entry
---

One of Capri's key features is that it allows you to render your site not only as static HTML,
but also as a static single page app. While this is primarily intended as a way to get
live previews of your content when working with a CMS, it also helps to speed up the
development process as it allows you to take advantage of Vite's development server and
hot reloading capabilities.

This is how a typical client entry script looks like for React:

```ts
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

import { App } from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("app")!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </StrictMode>
);
```

As you can see, there is nothing special here. It looks exactly like for any other
regular single page app. You can find examples for other frameworks in the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/capri-js/capri/tree/main/examples).

<Note>
  If you don't want to use Capri's SPA mode for previews, you can also omit this
  file and let your `index.html` point directly to the server entry file.
