title: Server entry
---

To generate static markup, Capri expects a file called `<your-entry>.server.*` right next to your client side entry script. If for example your `index.html` points to `./src/main.tsx` Capri looks for a file called `./src/main.server.tsx`. Take a look at the different framework demos for a real world example.

The render function receives the pathname of the page to be rendered as argument and returns the markup to be injected into the index.html file.
The markup is returned as object with CSS selectors as keys. This makes it possible to inject different chunks of HTML into different locations of the template, for example `head` and `#root`.

## Paths to prerender

Capri always starts with rendering `"/"` and proceeds with all local links it encounters. In order to render paths that are not discoverable via links, you can add an async `getStaticPaths()` function to your server entry script.
