title: Server entry
---

To generate static markup, Capri expects a file called `<your-entry>.server.*` right next to your
client side entry script. If for example your `index.html` points to `./src/main.tsx` Capri looks
for a file called `./src/main.server.tsx`.

## The render function

The render function receives the pathname of the page to be rendered as argument and returns the
markup to be injected into the index.html file.

The markup is returned as object with CSS selectors as keys. This makes it possible to inject
different chunks of HTML into different locations of the template, for example `head` and `#root`.

You can find examples for different frameworks in the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/capri-js/capri/tree/main/examples).
This is what a typical render function for React looks like:

```ts
import type { RenderFunction } from "@capri-js/react";

import { StrictMode } from "react";
import renderToString from "react-render-to-string";
import { StaticRouter } from "react-router-dom/server.js";

import { App } from "./App";

export const render: RenderFunction = async (url: string) => {
  return {
    "#app": await renderToString(
      <StrictMode>
        <StaticRouter location={url}>
          <App />
        </StaticRouter>
      </StrictMode>
    ),
  };
};
```

<Note>
  This example uses the
  [react-render-to-string](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-render-to-string)
  package instead of the synchronous
  [ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html#rendertostaticmarkup)
  to support data loading via suspense.
</Note>

## Paths to prerender

Capri always starts with rendering `"/"` and proceeds with all local links it encounters.
In order to render paths that are **not discoverable via links**, you can add an async `getStaticPaths()`
function to your server entry script.

```ts
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return ["/some-page", "/another-page"];
}
```

<Note>
  In most cases you won't need to implement this function as Capri will
  automatically follow all links and prerender them.
