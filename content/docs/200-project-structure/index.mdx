These are the main building blocks when it comes to the structure of a Capri site:

<TwoCols>
  <Card link="/docs/project-structure/template" title="The index.html template">
    The main entry file that points to your JavaScript code.
  </Card>
  <Card link="/docs/project-structure/configuration" title="Vite config">
    Capri is implemented as Vite plugin, hence you need to add it to your Vite
    config file.
  </Card>
  <Card link="/docs/project-structure/client-entry" title="Client entry">
    The entry file for the client side rendering. This is only used when
    generating a SPA for content previews or during development.
  </Card>
  <Card link="/docs/project-structure/server-entry" title="Server entry">
    The entry file for the server side rendering. This is used to render your
    static HTML pages.
  </Card>
</TwoCols>
