title: Configuration
---

Capri is based on Vite and doesn't try to hide it. Instead of introducing another level of abstraction,
possibly with its own configuration file, we decided to keep things simple. Therefore, Capri is configured via the
`vite.config.ts` file:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

// Vite plugin for the framework you are using:
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

// Capri adapter for your framework:
import capri from "@capri-js/react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    capri({
      // options
    }),
  ],
});
```

Currently there are three framework adapters to choose from:

- React: [@capri-js/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@capri-js/react)
- Preact: [@capri-js/preact](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@capri-js/preact)
- Svelte: [@capri-js/svelte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@capri-js/svelte)
- SolidJS: [@capri-js/solid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@capri-js/solid)

## Options

### `createIndexFiles`

Whether Capri should generate pages as `<page>.html` or `<page>/index.html`. The default is `true`.

### `spa`

The pathname, relative to the `dist` dir, where Capri should render the whole site as
single page app. Use this setting if you want live previews for your CMS. Can be either a `string`
or `false` (default).

The actual location depends on the `createIndexFiles` option:

```ts
{
  createIndexFiles: true,
  spa: "/preview",
}
// -> dist/preview/index.html
```

Whereas...

```ts
{
  createIndexFiles: false,
  spa: "/preview",
}
// -> dist/preview.html
```

### `prerender`

Tells Capri which files should be prerendered. Can either be a `string` or
`string[]` or an async function that returns an array of strings.
The default is `/`.

### `followLinks`

Whether Capri should recursively look for local links in the rendered result
and render them too. Can either be a `boolean` or a filter function:

```ts
{
  followLinks: (pathname: string) => !pathname.includes("dynamic");
}
```

### `islandGlobPattern`

Where to find [islands](/docs/advanced/partial-hydration). The default is `/src/**/*.island.*`;

### `lagoonGlobPattern`

Where to find [lagoons](/docs/advanced/partial-hydration/#lagoons). The default is `/src/**/*.lagoon.*`;
