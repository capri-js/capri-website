title: Islands
---

One of Capri's core features is that it supports partial hydration, also known
as [islands architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/). This
means that Capri sites will by default ship zero KB of JavaScript to the
browser. If you need some interactivity on your pages, you can selectively
_hydrate_ these components.

All you have to do to create an island is to name your component `*.island.*`.
Refer to the [docs](/docs/frameworks) for island examples in various UI frameworks.

<Note title="Breaking Change">
  Since Capri v4 islands must be the default export.

## lagoons

You might sometimes want to create dynamic islands that in turn contain static content.
In Capri you have to options to do this:

1.) Pass the static content as children to your islands. When hydrated, Capri will replace
the children by a component that renders the original HTML as it was generated on the server.

2.) Create a lagoon. By naming a component `*.lagoon.*` you can mark it as static, and it will
never be included in a client JavaScript bundle. Instead, it will be replaced by a component
that renders the HTML as it was originally rendered by the server.

## Island options

You can customize the hydration behaviour by exporting an `options` object.

### `media: string`

Only hydrate the component when the given media query matches. In the following example
the hydration of the component will be deferred until the viewport width gets below 700 pixels:

```ts
// BurgerMenu.island.tsx

export const options = {
  media: "(max-width: 700px)",
};

export default function BurgerMenu() {
  // ...
}
```

In a Svelte component, it would look like this:

```html
<script context="module">
  export const options = {
    media: "(max-width: 700px)",
  };
</script>

<!-- ... -->
```

<Note title="Stay tuned">
  We are planing to add more options, for example to only hydrate islands that
  are within the viewport.
