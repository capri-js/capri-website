title: index.html
---

The `index.html` file in your project's root directory is used as template for all your rendered pages.
This is where you can add common things like a viewport meta tag or a favicon.

This file needs to contain a script tag that points to your JavaScript code. Refer to the [Vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#index-html-and-project-root) to learn how HTML files are processed.
