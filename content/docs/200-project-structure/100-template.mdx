title: index.html

The `index.html` file in your project's root directory is used as template for all your rendered pages.
This is where you can add common things like a viewport meta tag or a favicon. But most importantly,
it needs to contain a script tag that points to your JavaScript code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/src/favicon.svg" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Note how the HTML code does not contain any placeholders. In order for Capri to know where your rendered
HTML should be injected, the `render` function exported by your
[server entry script](/docs/project-structure/server-entry) must specify a CSS selector like `#root`:

```ts
import { renderAppToString } from "some-framework";
import { collectHeadContent } from "some-library";

export async function render(url: string) {
  const appHtml = await renderAppToString(url);
  const headContent = collectHeadContent();
  return {
    head: headContent,
    "#root": appHtml,
  };
}
```

This allows you to inject different chunks of HTML at different places. You can for example use a library
like [hoofd](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/hoofd) to collect title and meta tags and append them to the
document head. Another common use-case is the collection of styles, for example when using
[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#server-side-rendering).
