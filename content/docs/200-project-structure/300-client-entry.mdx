One of Capri's key features is that it allows you to render your site not only as static HTML, but also as a static single page app. While this is primarily intended as a way to get live previews of your content when working with a CMS, it also helps to speed up the development process as it allows you to take advantage of Vite's development server and hot reloading capabilities.
