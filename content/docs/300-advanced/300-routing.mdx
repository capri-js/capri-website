title: Routing

Capri does not come with a built-in routing solution. Instead it let's you choose
whatever routing library you want.

Popular options are [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/),
[Wouter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wouter),
[preact-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/preact-router)
or Solid's [solid-app-router](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-app-router).

Depending on your site, you might not even need a router at all.
For example it's a totally valid approch to look up the content
for the requested URL and decide how to render it based on its data.

We believe that choosing a rendering pattern like SSG should not enforce a
particular way of building your site. It should instead feel as if you were
building a regular SPA or SSR application. In fact this is what allows Capri
to generate a preview SPA along your static HTML pages.
