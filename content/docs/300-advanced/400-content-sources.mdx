Capri was build with headless content management systems in mind.

Check out the [1-click Sanity starter](/docs/getting-started/sanity-starter) to see how to
manage a Capri site with Sanity.io.

This website however is powered by [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) which transforms
local MDX files to type-safe JSON data.

We are currently planning to add more integration demos for:

- [Storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/)
- [Tina CMS](https://tina.io/)
- [Payload](https://payloadcms.com/)
