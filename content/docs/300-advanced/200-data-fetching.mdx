title: Data fetching
---

Unlike other frameworks, Capri is not involved in how you fetch your data.
That means that every component can fetch its own data as needed.

Popular options are [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/), Vercel's
[SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or
[React Router's data API](https://beta.reactrouter.com/en/dev/getting-started/data).

## Async rendering

For this to work you need to make sure that the `render` function in your
[server entry file](/docs/project-structure/server-entry) supports async rendering.

SolidJS [supports this](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest#rendertostringasync) by default:

```ts
import { renderToStringAsync } from "solid-js/web";
```

For Preact you can use the [prerender](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr/tree/main/packages/preact-iso#prerenderjs)
from `preact-iso`:

```ts
import { prerender } from "preact-iso";
```

Whereas for React you can use the [react-render-to-string](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-render-to-string)
package:

```ts
import renderToString from "react-render-to-string";
```
