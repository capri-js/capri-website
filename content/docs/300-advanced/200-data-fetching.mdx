title: Data fetching
---

Unlike other frameworks, Capri is not involved in how you fetch your data.
That means that every component can fetch its own data as needed.

Popular options are [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/), Vercel's
[SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or
[React Router's data API](https://beta.reactrouter.com/en/dev/getting-started/data).

## Async rendering

For this to work you need to make sure that the `render` function in your
[server entry file](/docs/project-structure/server-entry) supports async rendering.

For convenience, all Capri framework adapters export a `renderToString` function:

```ts
import { renderToString } from "@capri-js/react";
import { renderToString } from "@capri-js/preact";
import { renderToString } from "@capri-js/solid";
```

For SolidJS this is a re-export of [renderToStringAsync](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest#rendertostringasync) from `solid-js/web`.
For Preact this is a re-export of [prerender](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr/tree/main/packages/preact-iso#prerenderjs)
from `preact-iso`.
And for React, this is a re-export of [react-render-to-string](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-render-to-string).
