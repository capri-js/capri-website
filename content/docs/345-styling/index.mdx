Capri can be used with all kinds of CSS frameworks. Since Capri is based on Vite,
you get built in support for [CSS Modules](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css-modules),
[PostCSS](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#postcss) and
[pre-processors](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css-pre-processors) like Sass, Less and Stylus.

Other CSS solutions usually provide guides on how to use them with Vite. Here is a list of React-based
examples for some of the most popular styling solutions:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://stackblitz.com/github/capri-js/capri-tailwind-react)
- [styled-components](https://stackblitz.com/github/capri-js/capri-styled-components-react)
- [vanilla-extract](https://stackblitz.com/github/capri-js/capri-vanilla-extract-react)
