title: Creating islands
---

Create a regular React/Preact/SolidJS component and name it `*.island.(tsx|jsx)`.

Import the `island` function from `virtual:island` to create a higher order component like this:

```tsx
// Counter.island.tsx

import { useState } from "preact/hooks";
import { island } from "virtual:island";

function Counter() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      {counter}
      <button onClick={() => setCounter((c) => c + 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export const CounterIsland = island(Counter);
```

<Note>
  The name of the export doesn't matter, you can also use a default export if
  you want.
</Note>

Use that wrapped component in your app to opt in to client-side hydration for that particular subtree:

```ts
// App.tsx

import { CounterIsland } from "./Counter.island";

export function App() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>
        Welcome to <i>Capri</i>
      </h1>
      <div>This page is static, but contains some dynamic parts.</div>
      <div>
        Here is a simple counter: <CounterIsland />
      </div>
      <div>
        And here is another one, independent from the one above:
        <CounterIsland start={100} />
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

<Note title="Stay tuned">
  We are planing to add more fine grained control about when the hydration
  happens. For example only when the island enters the viewport or when a
  certain media query matches.
</Note>
