title: Partial hydration
---

One of Capri's core features is that it supports partial hydration, also known
as [islands architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/). This
means that Capri sites will by default ship zero KB of JavaScript to the
browser. If you need some interactivity on your pages you can selectively
_hydrate_ these components.
