## Create a new site

```bash
npm init capri my-capri-site -- -e react
```

This will download and install [capri-js/capri/examples/react](https://github.com/capri-js/capri/tree/main/examples/react).

You can view a [deployed version](https://capri-js.github.io/capri/react/) of the demo on GitHub pages,
including the [preview SPA](https://capri-js.github.io/capri/react/preview/).

## Entry files

The client entry file is a regular React single page app. We render a `<PreviewBanner>`
on top of the app, so users know that they are viewing the SPA version, which is usually
the case when they are editing the site in a CMS.

```tsx
// src/main.tsx

import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

import { App } from "./App";
import { PreviewBanner } from "./Preview.jsx";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("app")!).render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <PreviewBanner />
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

On the server, we use `renderToString` and a `StaticRouter` instead:

```tsx
// src/main.server.tsx

import { renderToString } from "@capri-js/react/server";
import { StaticRouter } from "react-router-dom/server.js";

import { App } from "./App";

export async function render(url: string) {
  return {
    "#app": await renderToString(
      <StaticRouter location={url}>
        <App />
      </StaticRouter>
    ),
  };
}
```

## Islands

you can define interactive islands by naming your components `*.island.tsx`:

```tsx
// src/Counter.island.tsx

import { useState } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(start);
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCounter((c) => c - 1)}>-</button>
      <span>{counter}</span>
      <button onClick={() => setCounter((c) => c + 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Media queries

You can export an `options` object to hydrate an island as soon as a media query matches.
The following example will hydrate once the viewport width gets below 700px:

```ts
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export const options = {
  media: "(max-width:700px)",
};

export default function MediaQuery() {
  const [content, setContent] = useState(
    "Resize your browser below 700px to hydrate this island."
  );
  useEffect(() => {
    setContent("The island has been hydrated.");
  }, []);
  return <div>{content}</div>;
}
```

## Data fetching

You can either let your components fetch data or use a router that supports data fetching.

Here is an [example](https://github.com/capri-js/capri-tanstack-router-react) that uses TanStack Router to load some data.

Another option is to use [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) version `1.x`:

```ts
// src/Profile.tsx

const fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then((res) => res.json());

export function Profile() {
  const user = useSWR("https://api.example.com", fetcher, { suspense: true });
  return <div>Hello {user.name}!</div>;
}
```

Add a `<Suspense>` boundary somewhere above in your component tree where you want to render a fallback
while the data is loading. The fallback will only be shown in the preview SPA. When generating static
pages, Capri will wait until all data is loaded.

```ts
// src/App.tsx

export function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>loading...</div>}>
      <Profile />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

<Note>
  This will only work with SWR 1.x due to [this
  change](https://github.com/vercel/swr/issues/1906). It's [not entirely
  clear](https://github.com/capri-js/capri/issues/39) if/how data fetching
  inside a component is supposed to work in the future, so letting the router
  fetch data outside of React is currently the best option.
</Note>
