title: Why Capri
---

With Capri you can build a static website as if it was a single page app.
There are **no new APIs or patterns** to learn. If you know how to build a SPA in your [framework
of choice](/docs/frameworks), you already know everything it takes.

But in contrast to a single page app, Capri sites ship **zero KB of JavaScript** to the browser by default.

If **parts** of your site need to be interactive, you turn them into [islands](/docs/project-structure/islands/)
by simply naming your components `*.island.(tsx|vue|svelte)`.

The big advantage of this approach is that you get an SPA version of your site for free!
Why would you want that? It allows you to get **instant live previews** of any content edits you make,
right inside your [headless CMS](/docs/integrations/).
