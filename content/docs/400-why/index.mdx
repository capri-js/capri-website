title: Why Capri
---

📒 With Capri, you can build a static website as if it was a single page app.
There are **no new APIs or patterns** to learn. If you know how to build an SPA in your [framework
of choice](/docs/frameworks), you already know everything it takes.

🔓 **No lock-in.** When adopting a new tool, there is always a risk that it will be abandoned and no
longer maintained. A Capri site does not contain any Capri-specific code at all. If you remove the
Capri plugin from your Vite config, you end up with a fully functional application, albeit no longer static.

🌴 With new tools, it often takes years for an ecosystem to develop around them, if this happens at all.
This is different with Capri, as it allows you to **use the ecosystem of your favorite framework** directly,
without any detours.

🪫 Many tools and meta-frameworks today come with batteries included. While this is very convenient
for the user, it often makes it difficult, if not impossible, to [**break new ground**](https://twitter.com/fgnass/status/1601884283211325440).

⚡️ In contrast to SPAs or hybrid websites, Capri ships **zero KB of JavaScript** to the browser by default.
Not only does this make Capri sites super fast, but it also results in a smaller carbon footprint.

🏝 If **parts** of your site need to be interactive, you turn them into [islands](/docs/project-structure/islands)
by simply naming your components `*.island.(tsx|vue|svelte)`.

🔮 The big advantage of this approach is that you get an SPA version of your site for free!
Why would you want that? It allows you to get **instant live previews** of any content edits you make,
right inside your [headless CMS](/docs/integrations).
