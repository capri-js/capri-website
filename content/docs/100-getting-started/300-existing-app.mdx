title: Adding to an existing Vite app
---

If you already have a working Vite single page app, you can render it as static site by following these steps:

### 1. Install the Capri Vite plugin for your framework of choice:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @capri-js/react` # or preact or solid
```

### 2. Add the plugin to your `vite.config.ts` file:

```ts
import capri from "@capri-js/react";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), capri()],
});
```

### 3. Modify the build script in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build && vite build --ssr"
  }
}
```

### 4. Add a server entry scripts

Finally you have to provide a [server entry script](/docs/project-structure/server-entry) to tell Capri how to render your app as html.
