title: Creating a new Capri site
---

Capri provides some [example projects](https://github.com/capri-js/capri/tree/main/examples) that help you to quickly bootstrap a new project. The following command will create a new project based on the official react template in a directory called `my-capri-site`:

```bash
npm init capri my-capri-site -- -e react
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn create capri my-capri-site -e react
```

<Note>
  Refer to the [UI framework](/docs/frameworks) docs to learn how to use Capri
  with a particular framework.

## Community templates

You can use any Capri template hosted on GitHub using the following syntax:

```bash
npm init capri my-capri-site -- -e github-user/repo-name
```
