[Storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/) is a headless, API-based CMS as a service.

When used with Capri, you get a completely static site that does not need a Node server and can be deployed
to any static hosting service, including S3, GitHub Pages, surge or Firebase Hosting.

We've converted the original [Vue example project](https://github.com/storyblok/bootstrap-nuxt-demo) from Nuxt.js to Capri.
The [source code for this port](https://github.com/capri-js/storyblok-demo-capri) is on GitHub.

Follow this recipe to create your own fork and deploy it to Netlify:

1. [Register](https://app.storyblok.com/#!/signup) at Storyblok.
2. Create a new _DEMO Space_.
3. Go to _Setttings > Access Tokens_ and copy the preview token
4. Hit the deploy button and paste your token:

     Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/capri-js/storyblok-demo-capri)
   </div>
5. Watch the build output and copy the preview URL
6. Open app.storyblok.com and go to _Settings > Visual Editor_
