title: Sanity
---

[Sanity.io](https://sanity.io) is a SaaS platform that provides a real-time data store for
structured content. It comes with its own open-source editing environment called
[Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/docs/sanity-studio) that you can host yourself and
lives right next to your website. Sanity has generous included quotas, so getting started
is free.

The easiest way to get started is by using the 1-click starter:

Here is a screencast of what will happen when you click the button:

## Things to note

<Note>
  The rest of this guide assumes you are already familiar with Sanity in general
  and focused on the aspects that are special when using it together with Capri.

## Fetching data from Sanity

Since Capri has no abstraction layer around data-fetching, it's up to your page components
to load the required data. In our [starter template](https://github.com/capri-js/sanity-template-capri-react)
we use custom hooks to do so.

Here is the `usePageData()` hook taken straight from the starter template:

```ts
import { useLocation } from "react-router-dom";
import useSWR from "swr";
import { client } from ".";
import { Page } from "./schema";
import { usePreviewSubscription } from "./usePreviewSubscription";

const pageQuery = `*[_type == "Page" && slug.current == $slug]`;

export async function fetchPage(slug: string) {
  const [page] = await client.fetch<Page[]>(pageQuery, { slug });
  return page;
}

export function usePageData() {
  const location = useLocation();
  const slug = location.pathname;
  const { data: initialData } = useSWR(slug, fetchPage, {
    suspense: true,
  });
  const { data } = usePreviewSubscription(pageQuery, {
    initialData,
    params: { slug },
  });
  return data;
}
```

Let's take a step-by-step look at what it does:

1. It defines a [GROQ](https://www.sanity.io/docs/groq) query to load
   a Page by its slug:

   ```
   *[_type == "Page" && slug.current == $slug]
   ```

2. It defines a [fetcher](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/data-fetching) for SWR
   that uses the [sanity client](https://www.sanity.io/docs/js-client) to execute
   the query. The SWR hook is called with `suspense: true` so Capri will wait for
   the result, before it renders the static HTML.

3. It calls a second hook called `usePreviewSubscription` with the same query and
   parameters which will provide us with live updates when the page is viewed in
   preview mode.

## Adding live previews

While all our pages should be completely static and should not ship any JavaScript
to the browser at all, we want a separate page for live previews that can render
our whole site as single page app.

The first thing we have to do, is to tell Capri that it should generate such an
SPA under `/preview/index.html`:

```ts
// web/vite.config.ts

import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import capri from "@capri-js/react/vite-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    capri({
      spa: "/preview",
    }),
  ],
});
```

Next we add a banner to our client entry file to make users aware that
they are in preview mode:

```tsx
// web/src/main.tsx

import { StrictMode } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import { App } from "./App";
import { PreviewBanner } from "./components/PreviewBanner";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("app")!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <PreviewBanner />
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </StrictMode>
);
```

In our App, we add a `/preview` route:

```tsx
import { Suspense } from "react";
import { Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";

import { Preview } from "./Preview";
import { Page } from "./Page";

export function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/preview" element={<Preview />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<Page />} />
      </Routes>
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

When rendered, the `Preview` component reads a `slug` parameter from the URL
and uses the history API to navigate to the requested page:

```tsx
// web/src/Preview.tsx

import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useNavigate, useSearchParams } from "react-router-dom";

/**
 * Handle preview requests like `/preview?slug=/about` by redirecting
 * to the given slug parameter.
 */
export function Preview() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
  useEffect(() => {
    const slug = searchParams.get("slug");
    if (slug) {
      navigate(slug);
    }
  });
  return null;
}
```

Finally, we have to configure the Sanity Studio to add [preview links](https://www.sanity.io/docs/preview-content-on-site). This is what our `resolveProductionUrl.ts` file should look like:

```ts
// studio/resolveProductionUrl.ts

export default function resolveProductionUrl(document) {
  return `https://my-site.com/preview?slug=${document.slug.current}`;
}
```

For even more convenience, you can set up a split view with an
[iframe pane](https://www.sanity.io/plugins/iframe-pane) in your `deskStructure.ts` file.
